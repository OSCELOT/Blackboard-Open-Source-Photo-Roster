# Blackboard-Open-Source-Photo-Roster

Welcome to the Open Photo Roster building block.

For more information please visit: ScholarWorks Release - http://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/oer_teaching/1

 Implementation steps:

This version of the photo roster includes the Bb Avatars and Gravatar rosters.  Administrators can upload pictures to the Avatar system or allow users upload their own pictures.  The Gravatar system at gravatar.com allows users to associate pictures with their own photos.

To enable ID Photos in the building block please contact support@dataii.com.

A Saas version of the system with LTI is available here: https://appcatalog.blackboard.com/details/class-dashboard-photo-roster/
